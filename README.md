# NFLScoreboard.info

This is the source of [NFLScoreboard.info](https://nflscoreboard.info) which is a quick learning project for ReactJS. The goal is to build a scoreboard and information center to monitor multiple games at once. The main purposes were to (a) start learning reactjs and (b) see if I could derive traffic from https://twitter.com/nflbigplays.
